# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

This module focuses on the AI components that provide perception and decision-making capabilities to robotic systems. You'll learn about NVIDIA Isaac for advanced perception, synthetic data generation, VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and navigation for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Implement perception systems using Isaac ROS packages
- Apply VSLAM techniques for robot localization and mapping
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation
- Integrate AI perception with ROS 2 systems

## Chapters

1. [Isaac Sim Basics + Synthetic Data](./isaac-sim-basics) - Introduction to Isaac Sim and data generation
2. [Isaac ROS + VSLAM](./isaac-ros-vslam) - Perception and localization systems
3. [Nav2 for Humanoids](./nav2-humanoids) - Navigation and path planning

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1 and 2
- Basic understanding of computer vision concepts
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts (helpful but not required)

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll have the AI perception and navigation capabilities needed to create intelligent robotic systems for Module 4.
