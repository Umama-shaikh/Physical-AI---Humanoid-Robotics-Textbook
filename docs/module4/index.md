# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

This final module brings together all previous concepts to create a complete autonomous humanoid system. You'll learn to implement Whisper-based voice recognition, LLM-based cognitive planning, and create an end-to-end pipeline that responds to natural language commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement voice-to-action pipelines using Whisper for speech recognition
- Create LLM-based cognitive planning systems for robot decision-making
- Integrate all components into a complete autonomous humanoid pipeline
- Design natural language interfaces for robot control
- Validate the complete system functionality

## Chapters

1. [Voice-to-Action (Whisper)](./voice-to-action) - Speech recognition and command processing
2. [LLM Cognitive Planning](./llm-planning) - Decision-making and planning systems
3. [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid](./capstone-autonomous) - Complete system integration

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of all previous concepts
- Basic knowledge of natural language processing (helpful but not required)

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll have built a complete autonomous humanoid system that can respond to voice commands and perform complex tasks.
