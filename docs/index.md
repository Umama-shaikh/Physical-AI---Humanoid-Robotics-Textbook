# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## A Beginner-Friendly Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This book is designed to take you from beginner-level understanding to building complete autonomous humanoid systems.

### About This Book

This textbook covers four essential modules that will teach you to use ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems to control humanoid robots, ending with a complete autonomous humanoid pipeline.

### Modules Overview

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn ROS 2 fundamentals, middleware concepts, nodes, topics, services, and how to bridge Python agents with ROS controllers
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore physics simulation, environment building, sensor simulation, and human-robot interaction
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Discover advanced perception, synthetic data generation, VSLAM, and navigation for humanoid robots
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Implement voice-to-action pipelines and LLM-based cognitive planning

### Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Beginner-level students
- Makers and hobbyists
- Early developers entering embodied AI and humanoid robotics

### Getting Started

Start with [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module1) to build a strong foundation before moving to more advanced topics.
