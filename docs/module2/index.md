# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

This module explores physics simulation environments that serve as digital twins for robotic systems. You'll learn about Gazebo for physics simulation and sensor modeling, as well as Unity for human-robot interaction visualization.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo physics simulation environments
- Model and simulate various types of robot sensors (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)
- Create human-robot interaction interfaces using Unity
- Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 systems
- Validate robot behaviors in simulated environments

## Chapters

1. [Gazebo Physics Simulation](./gazebo-simulation) - Setting up physics environments
2. [Simulated Sensors (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)](./simulated-sensors) - Sensor modeling and simulation
3. [Unity for Human-Robot Interaction](./unity-hri) - Visualization and interaction design

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D visualization concepts (helpful but not required)

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll understand how to create and validate robotic systems in simulation before moving to real-world applications in Module 3.
