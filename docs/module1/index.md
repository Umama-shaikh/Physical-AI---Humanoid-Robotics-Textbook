# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

This module introduces you to the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the nervous system for robotic applications. You'll learn about nodes, topics, services, and how to create Python agents that communicate with ROS controllers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 middleware
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Connect Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy

## Chapters

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals) - Core concepts and basic communication
2. [Python Agents → ROS Controllers (rclpy)](./python-agents-ros) - Connecting Python code to ROS
3. [URDF for Humanoids](./urdf-humanoids) - Modeling humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll have the foundational knowledge needed to work with robotic systems and will be ready to explore simulation environments in Module 2.
