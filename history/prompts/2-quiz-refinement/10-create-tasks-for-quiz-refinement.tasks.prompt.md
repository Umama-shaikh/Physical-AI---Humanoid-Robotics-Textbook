# Create Tasks For Quiz Refinement PHR

## Command
$ARGUMENTS

## Outcome
Successfully generated comprehensive task list for implementing the refined quiz system. The tasks are organized in 7 phases with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. The implementation follows an incremental approach starting with foundational components, followed by user story implementations in priority order (P1, P1, P2). Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where applicable, and clear descriptions with file paths. The MVP scope includes authoritative quiz component and one module with both inline and end-of-module assessments for early validation of the dual assessment model.

## Summary
Created detailed task breakdown for quiz system refinement with 51 specific, actionable tasks organized in 7 phases with user story prioritization.
