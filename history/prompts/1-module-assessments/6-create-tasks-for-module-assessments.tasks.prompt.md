# Create Tasks For Module Assessments PHR

## Command
$ARGUMENTS

## Outcome
Successfully generated comprehensive task list for implementing module-level assessment requirements. The tasks are organized in 7 phases with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. The implementation follows an incremental approach starting with foundational components, followed by user story implementations in priority order (P1, P2, P3). Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where applicable, and clear descriptions with file paths. The MVP scope includes quiz components and integration into one module for early validation.

## Summary
Created detailed task breakdown for module-level assessments with 50 specific, actionable tasks organized in 7 phases with user story prioritization.
